I don't wanna lose my mind
I don't wanna lose myself
Tell me if I crossed the line
I ain't tryin' to hurt myself
Didn't want to call your name
Only got myself to blame, oh, yeah

In my world, in my mind, always runnin' out of time
In my love, in my heart, you're the only kryptonite
But I
But I wait for you, still I wait for you

Yeah, it feels so good, I might just lose my mind
No question if it's wrong or right
Ain't no way to tell which way it's gonna go, yeah
